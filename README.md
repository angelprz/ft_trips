Hey everybody!
I'm √Ångel, and this is the result of one week learning Dart and Flutter from scratch.

I had absolutely no knowledge of these technologies before last Thursday 28th of February. My only support has been my previous knowledge of JavaScript and React that I have learned in the last two years.

I spent the first days learning the basic syntax of Dart, which is almost identical to JavaScript in many aspects. This made me feel very comfortable with the language and I was able to write code in Dart in no time.

When I thought that I had a strong-enough basis of Dart, I started learning the structure of a Flutter app. I was surprised by its similarities with React. It's modular design using "widgets" and its declarative style makes it very easy to read and write.

After that I started my very first Flutter app.

I have to say that this is a very basic app. It has almost no state and basically displays some of the most common elements in a mobile app. But to have done it in just a couple of days, I think it's not bad at all.

This week has been has been a little exhausting. But, nevertheless, I have really enjoyed this journey.

Even though I have spent many hours in front of my PC learning this new technology, now I feel a huge satisfaction seeing the results of this process.

Hope you like it!
