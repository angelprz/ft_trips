Hey everybody!
I'm √Ångel, and this is the result of one week learning Dart and Flutter from scratch.

I had absolutely no knowledge of these technologies before last Thursday 28th of February. My only support has been my previous knowledge of JavaScript and React that I have learned in the last two years.

I spent the first days learning the basic syntax of Dart, which is almost identical to JavaScript in many aspects. This made me feel very comfortable with the language and I was able to write code in Dart in no time.

When I thought that I had a strong-enough basis of Dart, I started learning the structure of a Flutter app. I was surprised by its similarities with React. It's modular design using "widgets" and its declarative style makes it very easy to understand.

After that I started my very first Flutter app.

I have to say that this is a very basic app. It has almost no state and it basically displays some of the most common elements in a mobile app. But to have done it in a couple of days, it's not bad at all.


## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. 

  

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
